# Automatic Car Barrier System

This project was developed as a first semester project for
Mechatronics Engineering.

## Project Overview
The Automatic Car Barrier System uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect
an approaching vehicle and controls a barrier using a servo motor.
An ESP32 microcontroller is used as the main controller.

## Working Principle
- The ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of a vehicle.
- When a vehicle comes within a set distance, the ESP32 sends a signal
  to the servo motor.
- The servo motor rotates to open the barrier.
- After the vehicle passes, the barrier closes automatically.

## Components Used
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Servo motor
- Power supply
- Connecting wires

## Project Type
Hardware-based academic project (Beginner level)

## Note
This was a first semester project, so the circuit diagram and source
code are not included. This repository focuses on the project concept
and working explanation.
